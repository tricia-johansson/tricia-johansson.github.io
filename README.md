# Why I'm here & about me
I'm mostly here to test drive my coding projects since I'm (re)-learning how to code after almost 10 years of... not coding. I think the best way to learn is to just do it, at least when it comes to coding and such skills.
I'm interested in web-based apps and building both games, websites and other applications. I'm very specific in my interest, especially in web apps, and that's probably just me being the autistic person I am 👀
So naturally I'm gravitating towards JavaScript and PHP and such.

Other interests are illustration/digital art, graphic design, writing, creating music, gaming, and tabletop games (RPGs like D&D), and I also have a YouTube channel so I'm into filmmaking and video as well.
One can not have too many interests 😄
